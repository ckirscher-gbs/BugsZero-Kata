This repository comes packaged with code that is totally tested, using the Golden Master technique. Pick the language of your choice in 
this repository or contribute another one. In case there is none
you're comfortable with you can always try to do this without tests
using any of the [available languages](https://github.com/caradojo/trivia). Beware that it is not identical as we've modified to the code to remove some of the noice that wasn't relevant to sources of bugs.

## Procedure
1. Identify a weakness in the design - now that's where we'e helping you
2. State what the potential bug is **before explaining your solution**. This is important, simply saying another 
solution is better avoids thinking of **why** it is actually better.
3. Explain or refactor the code to show the new design.

The purpose is to experiment with design alternatives, so it is not necessary to refactor until perfection, and it is optional to use tests.
The purpose of first explaining the problem in the design is to make sure that the new design is not just different but also adresses one or more specific problems.

## Existing bugs and weaknesses (in trivia)

* A Game could have less than two players - make sure it always has at least two.
  * Use a compiled language or a static type checker like flowtype
* Someone could try to create a game with 7 players, make sure that's impossible.
  * or slightly easier, allow for 7 players or more
* A player that get's into prison always stays there
  * Other than just fixing the bug, try to understand what's wrong with the design and fix the root cause 
* JS, Java, Swift and C# only: there's a bug with the money attribution, coins are added to the wrong player. Try to understand what made this bug likely and fix the design so that it becomes very unlikely.
* Introducing new categories of questions seems like tricky business.
  * Could you make sure all places have the "right" question and that the distribution 
  is always correct (i.e. same number of each category, distance always the same between categories)?
* The deck could run out of questions
  * Make sure that can't happen (a deck with 1 billion questions is cheating :)
* Similarly changing the board size greatly affects the questions distribution. i.e. how do we ensure that there are as many of each category and that they repeat in a cyclic way?
  * Is there a design where it is guaranteed that the question category distribution stays the same
