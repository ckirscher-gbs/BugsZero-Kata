Bugs are optional, they sneak into our code much thanks the design choices we do, or fail to do. Let's 
try refactoring some existing code to make it more bug-repellent!

You'll practice reading code, looking for parts where it is likely that developers would create a bug if they extended the code. Whenever you've found such a weakness in the design your challenge is to strengthen the design in order to make that kind of bug very unlikely, or even impossible!

**First** Identify a bug or a weakness in the design. **Then** Explain what feature could cause a bug. Or how the design contributed to its introduction. This is important, simply saying another solution is better avoids thinking of why it is actually better.
**Finally** Explain or refactor the code to show the new design. 

Prefer small changes in the design, for instance before applying a design pattern try simpler things, like maybe ExtractConstant or replace conditional logic with a map/dictionnary.

# Where do I start?

## Beginner
Make sure you know of a few ways to design away bugs, by looking at a few examples
* [5 steps to mistake-proof software design](http://mozaicworks.com/blog/5-steps-to-mistake-proof-software-design/)
* [It's not a configuration issue. Itâ€™s a design issue](http://martinsson-johan.blogspot.fr/2016/06/its-not-configuration-issue-its-design.html)

Have a look at the long list of common [bug-patterns](https://github.com/martinsson/BugsZero-Kata/blob/master/bug-patterns.md), mostly unnecessary weaknesses in design.
Beware, those are a bit terse, most patterns need to be explained. 

## Intermediate
We've found some weaknesses for you. Pick your choice in [instructions-intermediate.md](https://github.com/martinsson/BugsZero-Kata/blob/master/instructions-intermediate.md)

## Advanced
If you'e already accustomed this thinking this way, have a look at [instructions-advanced.md](https://github.com/martinsson/BugsZero-Kata/blob/master/instructions-advanced.md)

## Solutions
After doing your version, have a look at the [various solutions](https://github.com/martinsson/BugsZero-Kata/blob/master/solutions.md) in the form of merge-requests. It is easy to see what the change was using the diff-view. They are meant to be (on of) the best trade-offs for the given problem. There's always trade-offs, but if you find a better or simply good alternative, please fork and merge-request and we'll reference it.

## Next steps
Go use this on some other code base, like your project!
 
Give us some suggestions in the issues.
